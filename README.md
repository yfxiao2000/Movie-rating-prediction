# Modeling and Prediction for Movies

This repository contains an R Markdown file (`reg_model_project.Rmd`) that focuses on predictive modeling for movie IMDb ratings. The project uses statistical and data visualization techniques to explore and analyze the dataset.

## Contents

- **Setup**: Environment setup, including package loading and data preparation.
- **Part 1: Data**: Overview of the dataset and considerations for generalization and causality.
- **Part 2: Research Question**: Exploration of predictive models for IMDb ratings based on runtime, genre, MPAA rating, and release year.

## Requirements

- R packages:
  - ggplot2
  - dplyr
  - statsr
  - knitr (for rendering R Markdown)

## Analysis Objectives

1. Understand the dataset's characteristics and structure.
2. Build predictive models for IMDb ratings.
3. Evaluate the models' performance and derive insights.
